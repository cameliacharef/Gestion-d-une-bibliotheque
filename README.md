# Gestion-d-une-bibliotheque
Project Description:

This repository contains a mini-project focused on library management, where a library is represented as a collection of books. The main objective of this project is to compare different data structures for implementing a library. 

Specifically, we explore two approaches:

**1- Singly Linked List Implementation (Part 1):**

In this part, we implement a library using a singly linked list data structure. Each book is represented as a node in the list.

**2- Hash Table Implementation (Part 2):**

The second part of the project involves implementing a library using a hash table data structure. Books are stored in the hash table based on their attributes, allowing for efficient retrieval and management.

**Key Features:**

- Library management functionalities such as adding books, searching by title or author, and removing books.

- Comparative analysis of the performance and efficiency of the linked list and hash table implementations.

- Educational content aimed at understanding and comparing different data structures for real-world applications.
